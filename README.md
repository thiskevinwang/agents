# agents

This is a collection of tools to help me work with agents.

[./.cursor/commands](./.cursor/commands) is intended to be synced to Cursor's global commands (`~/.cursor/commands`) so that I can access tools without having to commit them to a particular git repository.

[./.github/prompts](./.github/prompts) is intended to be synced to a home directory folder (`~/.github/prompts`). VSCode's `chat.promptFilesLocations` setting should be updated to look for prompts here, since it otherwise doesn't specify a location for _global prompts_, unlike Cursor. See [docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/prompt-files#_sync-user-prompt-files-across-devices).

## TODO

Maybe this should just live in https://github.com/thiskevinwang/dotfiles?
