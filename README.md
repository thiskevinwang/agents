# agents

This is a collection of tools to help me work with agents.

[./.cursor/commands](./.cursor/commands) is intended to be synced to Cursor's global commands (`~/.cursor/commands`) so that I can access tools without having to commit them to a particular git repository.


## TODO

Maybe this should just live in https://github.com/thiskevinwang/dotfiles?
